# Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust

Welcome to the `dsa` repository, a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Rust. This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to explore the implementation of various data structures and algorithms using Rust's powerful and safe programming paradigms.

## About the Repository

This repository is read-only and designed for educational purposes. It contains a wide range of examples, from basic data structures like Linked Lists and Trees to complex algorithms like Sorting algorithms, Graph algorithms, and more.

### Features

- **Data Structures**: Includes basic and advanced data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Features a variety of algorithms, including Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **Rust Implementation**: All implementations leverage Rust's unique features like ownership, zero-cost abstractions, and safety guarantees.
- **Documentation**: Each module is documented to explain the logic and the Rust-specific considerations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `/data_structures` - Contains various data structures implementations.
- `/algorithms` - Contains different algorithm implementations.

Each sub-directory contains further categorization based on the type of data structure or algorithm.

## Usage

This repository is read-only and intended for educational purposes. You are encouraged to browse, study, and learn from the code. However, modifications and pull requests are not accepted.

## Contributing

As this is a read-only repository, contributions are not accepted. However, if you find any errors or issues, feel free to raise an issue for educational discussion.
